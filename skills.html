	<h3>Languages</h3>
	<p>I have experience in the following languages:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Python</li>
	  <li>Java</li>
	  <li>Javascript</li>
	  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
	  <li>SQL</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This list tends to be in order of my experience with these languages.  
	   I started off with Java and Python, and have devoloped my skills in the 
       rest more recently. Prior to Computer Science, I had a love for language 
	   learning, and have found that this translates to computer languages as well.    	  
	</p>
	<p>In a past job, I was an editor, and love to write clean, concise, and 
	   readable code. I believe if it's difficult to understand, it's going to be 
	   difficult to build upon. 
	</p>

    <h3>Software</h3>
	<p>I have experience in the following software:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Sumo Logic</li>
		<li>Jira</li>
		<li>Fullstory</li>
		<li>Github</li>
		<li>Mixpanel</li>
	  </ul>
	<p>Most of my relevant software experience centers around my current 
	   role at Tango Card.  Most of this software centers around system logging,
       session records, and javascript responses from our website.  		
	</p>
	<p>Less relevant software skills would be the Adobe Suite, Microsoft Suite,
	   MacOs, iOS, and tvOS.

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
	<p>The following are my strengths:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Learning agile</li>
		<li>Work well under pressure</li>
		<li>A great teammate</li>
		<li>Able to break a problem down</li>
		<li>Coachable</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Having started my professional career as a teacher, 
	     I bring the ability to balance a large number of things at the same time.  
	     In addition, I have a HUGE love for learning new things, and regularly 
	     throw myself into books or docs on new topics.   	  
	  </p>
	  <p>I love working in teams and investing in those around me.  
	     With that being said, I'm not adverse to taking on a project on my own.
	     I am driven by seeing problems solved, and love things work again.
